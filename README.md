SUBJECT: LOAN REPAYMENT PREDICTION

1.	Introduction

•	Context: Financial institutions take several variables into account when approving a loan. Determining whether a given borrower will fully pay off the loan or cause it to be charged off is difficult. If the lender is too strict, fewer loans get approved, which means there’s less interest to collect. But if they’re too lax, they end up approving loans that default.

This project aims to give an idea of applying Machine Learning model to predict in a real business scenario. In this project, apart from applying the techniques re, you will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

2.	Techniques applied in project

-	Define problem
-	EDA 
-	Data pre-processing
-	Build-up model (Logistic regression, XGBoost, Random Forest)
-	Evaluation of model
